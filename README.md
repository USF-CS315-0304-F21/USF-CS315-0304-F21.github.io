# site-template

### [Why](https://xkcd.com/1319)
1. Generate static web site for college courses
1. Simple to configure (Jekyll isn't)
1. Support tables (Google Sites doesn't)
1. Auto syntax highlight for code
1. Minimal work to author project specs (markdown)
1. Minimal daily work to update - no code (toml/mustache)

### Requirements
1. python3
1. pip3
1. packages: toml (config), markdown (codehilite), chevron (mustache)
1. Somewhere to publish with rsync. Could be replaced with github pages if preferred.

### Usage
1. I think I'll fork the template site into a new repo in each semester's github classroom
